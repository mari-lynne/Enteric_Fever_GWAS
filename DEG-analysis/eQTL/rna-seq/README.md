# VAST and Tyger RNAseq eQTL analysis: 11/02/23

- Disclaimer: scripts written towards end of write up - hence multiple versions
- I was testing different batch control approaches alongside so vast and tyger data could be combined

- Different output options include:
	- Just analysing cis-eqtls
	- Participants with challenge and no-vaccination
	- Specific-eqtl script lets you chose a gene region of intereste.g F2R genes
	- eQTL just of differentially epxressed genes

To do: 

- Go through scripts and finalise generalised version with options at the start for diff outputs
- Tidy!
